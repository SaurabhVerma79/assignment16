    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that offers a\n",
    "number of features that make it well-suited for handling modern applications. \n",
    "Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1-Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data as documents in BSON format, which allows\n",
    "for flexible and schema-less data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-High performance: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and\n",
    "provide high throughput and low latency for read and write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Scalability: MongoDB offers automatic sharding and horizontal scaling \n",
    "capabilities that allow for easy scaling of data storage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-High availability: MongoDB provides built-in replication and failover \n",
    "capabilities that ensure high availability and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Flexible indexing: MongoDB offers a variety of indexing options that allow for\n",
    "efficient querying and analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6-Aggregation framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that\n",
    "enables data processing, filtering, and analysis within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "7-Rich query language: MongoDB's query language allows for complex querying \n",
    "of data, including support for ad hoc queries, sorting, filtering, and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "8-JSON-like documents: MongoDB uses a document data model that is similar to JSON, \n",
    "which makes it easy to work with for developers familiar with JavaScript and other \n",
    "languages that work with JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "9-Dynamic schema: MongoDB allows for flexible data modeling, as new fields can be\n",
    "added to documents without having to modify the underlying schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "10-Open-source: MongoDB is an open-source database, which means that it is freely\n",
    "available for use and modification, and has a large and active community of users \n",
    "and contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's document-oriented approach, high performance, scalability,\n",
